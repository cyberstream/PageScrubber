Future development ideas:

- Add toolbar button that shows whether site is filtered. Clicking the button would toggle the status.
- Move the core blocked word list from inside the extension to a remote repository (maybe github?) so it can be modified without having to upload a whole new version of the extension.
- Usage stats reporting...maybe?
